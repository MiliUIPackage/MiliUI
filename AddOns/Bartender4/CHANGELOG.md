[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/Bartender4/compare/4.8.7...4.8.8)

- Update TOC for 8.2.5  
- Also re-layout the MicroMenu after taking it back over  
- Add a few additional hooks to restore the MicroMenu to its original state  
    Hopefully this can reduce the impact of other addons also messing with  
    the MainMenuBar
