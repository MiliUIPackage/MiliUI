[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/compare/10.0.7...10.0.8) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/releases)

- Prep emergency retial tag  
- Push major bugfix that caused brood encounter mod not to work at all on broodkeeper encounter, and instead load with final boss instead. (how did no one report this in 3 days of raid being open :o). This is a serious fuckup of epic proportions that broken two mods i worked really hard on. 'm so sorry :(  
- Don't announce non tanks eating a frontal on Kurog. That can be spammy and it's not DBMs job to monitor players in wrong place :D  
- Hackfix: Fix C Overlows when rendering stats.  
- Bump alpha
