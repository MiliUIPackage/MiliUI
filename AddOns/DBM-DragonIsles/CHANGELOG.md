- Some basrikron fixes while at it since I had to solo it earlier and had about 15 minutes worth of data to look at.  
- Removed redundant alert  
- I thought I pushed this, guess I did'n't. Small nelth timer tweak. sadly the remaining timer issues can't be fixed (initial p3 ones) cause that issue is actually a bug with way blizzard coded the transition.  
- bump alpha revisions
