## Changed in v2024.21

* Include season 1 world bosses
* Macros are rewritten for the 11.0 limitations (finally); now tries to target as many of the mobs close to you as will fit in 255 character, now can include (zone-specific) custom mobs, and has an option to target with `/tar` rather than `/targetexact` to save space
* Option in target-scanning to completely skip dead rares (this is more extreme than the existing option to not announce them,
* Fix an issue in classic when showing loot windows on popups
because it'll stop them from being added to the last-seen)
