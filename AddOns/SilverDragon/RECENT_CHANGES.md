## Changed in v2024.20

* Absolutely massive behind-the-scenes change to how I track loot, which you will hopefully notice nothing about apart from it allowing me to...
* Add weekly reputation quests and reputation rewards to War Within rares
* Show how long the shadow phase has left on the Spawn of Beledar
* Announcements: fix missing label for the Effects channel, add a test button that'll play the sound actually on the channel you selected so you can tell how loud it'll be
* Overlay: fix showing requirement colors inverted in overlay tooltips
* It's been 8 years: remove the database migration code from SilverDragon 2
