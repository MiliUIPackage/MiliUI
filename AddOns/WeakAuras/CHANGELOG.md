# [5.17.3](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/tree/5.17.3) (2024-10-22)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/compare/5.17.2...5.17.3)

## Highlights

- ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ Custom Triggers which listen to COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED without..ahem..*filtering* now generate a deprecation warning, and will cease functioning in a future update
- WeakAurasTemplates: Updated for 11.0.5. If we missed any, or got anything wrong, please let us know!
- Rogue: Charged Combo Points no longer have any special interpretation in Player/Unit Info - Power - Combo Points trigger. The associated overlay should continue to work as expected.
- WeakAurasArchive should be more conservative about when it loads, in the hopes of improving resiliency against SavedVariables loss
