# [5.19.8](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/tree/5.19.8) (2025-04-11)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/compare/5.19.7...5.19.8)

## Highlights

TOC update for SoD phase 8

New Features:

- states:Replace(id, newstate) & states:Get(id, key) are now available in TSU custom triggers
- subtext & condition change text learned to support UI escape sequences, like the text region type already does
- Spell Activation Overlay events are available in Cata classic, so the related trigger has been re-enabled for that game flavor
- Scarlet Enclave encounter IDs added for SoD

Fixes:

- Item Equipped load/trigger forces exact match now, to deal with e.g. normal/heroic versions of the same item
- unit formatters produces empty string "" instead of "nil" when the underlying unit token is invalid
- various fixes to options panel & thanks list so they don't look terrible (thanks @pewtro!)
- Fixed some templates which were invalidated in 11.1
- Reminded chat msg - emote trigger to pay attention to CHAT_MSG_TEXT_EMOTE again
