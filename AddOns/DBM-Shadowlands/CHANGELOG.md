# <DBM> World Bosses (Shadowlands)

## [9.2.19](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/tree/9.2.19) (2022-05-31)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/compare/9.2.18...9.2.19) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/releases)

- Bump version  
- toc bump  
- toc bump  
- Add proper detection of HoA difficulty indices  
- Add 3 trash warnings to Necrotic wake requested by user.  
- Fixed a bug where the informational nerf was applyed to voice pack sounds even if the setting wasn't enabed Informational nerf now also disables the range checker, since the range checker uses information not normally available to player (it basically exploits a bug blizzard never fixed in item check code). As such, it goes beyond the scope of providing information avaialble to base UI and should be included in the nerf.  
- Update localization.cn.lua (#126)  
- Update zhTW (#125)  
- Update koKR (#124)  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#762)  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#122)  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#123)  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#121)  
- Also remap adds alerts to only use \"adds are coming\" when in \"informational only\" mode.  
- Fixed a bug where filtered role specla announcements still played voice alerts Fixed a bug where the soak filter type wasn't filtering alerts that contain a soak position Added a new optiont to completely disable instructional alerts/audio. This is WIP (especially on voice pack end) but the goal is to provide ability to make DBM purely informational and do literally zero handholding or instruction what so ever. This will likely become the default (and maybe even mandatory if blizzard wills it) in the future when it's complete and no longer WIP.  
- Update zhTW (#118)  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#120) Translation of some phrases.  
- Update localization.cn.lua (#119)  
- Update koKR (#117)
