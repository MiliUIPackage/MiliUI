**r698:**

-----

**r697:**

> Added tracking for pets obtained in the Ny'alotha raid
<br>Added tracking for Skyshards in the phased 8.3 version of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms

> Fixed an error in the fishing detection that could prevent attempts from being registered correctly
<br>Fixed a UI issue that could cause the tooltip loading to fail

<br>Added tracking for the Zan-Tien Lasso (dropped by mogu in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms)
<br>Added tracking for pets obtained from 8.3 paragon caches
<br>Added missing toggle for BFA content in the configuration UI

Developer Notes:
> It appears that Blizzard broke the statistics for the Firelands raid when adding its Timewalking version. Detection for all bosses except Ragnaros and Alysrazor was changed to use NPC looting in order to work around this bug as best as possible, but attempts for items dropped by those two bosses might not always be detected until statistics are being updated correctly again
