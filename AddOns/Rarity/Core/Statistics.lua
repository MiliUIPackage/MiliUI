--- Calculate an estimate for an item's drop chance while considering other group members that are also eligible
-- Only modifies chances for SHARED Loot, i.e. those that are set to use a groupSize > 1
-- Note: Virtually all items are now PERSONAL loot by default, which means this no longer applies to them
-- Caveat: Rarity has no idea how many group members were actually present, so it uses a predefined estimate (stored in the groupSize field), but this is also used to categorize items according to their difficulty (...). This is why there is another field, equalOdds, which will override the groupSize calculation to effectively force Personal Loot everywhere
-- @param item A table containing the data (itemDB entry) that is to be used
-- @return The modified drop chance after accounting for shared loot, given as a percentage
-- @return The modified drop chance after accounting for shared loot, given as a fraction (1 in X)
