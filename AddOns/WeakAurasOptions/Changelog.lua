Update for The War Within 11.1

New in this version:

- models now have an alpha slider to set transparency
- TSU-type custom triggers have some new convenience functions available. Documentation is avaliable at https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/wiki/Trigger-State-Updater-(TSU)#all-states-
helper-methods
  - this is unlikely to matter, but note that the choice of plumbing used means this is techni
cally a breaking change if you ever created a state with the "__changed" key.

Fixes:

- x-realm transfer of auras should fail less often
- improve performance
