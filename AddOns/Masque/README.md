### About ###

*Masque* is an add-on for [World of Warcraft](http://us.battle.net/wow) that provides a skinning engine for button-based add-ons. Note that you **must** have an add-on that supports *Masque* installed in order to use it. *Masque* does **not** support the default interface.

### Installation ###

Install the package through your preferred add-on manager. You can also install the add-on manually using the following steps:

1. Download the package from one of the following sites:
    - [Curse](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/masque)
    - [WoW Ace](http://www.wowace.com/addons/masque)
    - [WoW Interface](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12097)
2. Extract the package to your **World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns** directory.

### Options ###

To access Masque's options, use the **/msq** or **/masque** chat commands. You can also access the options via the *Interface Options Window* or by clicking on *Masque*'s icon in a *DataBroker* display.

### FAQ ###

- *Add-on X is outdated and doesn't work with Masque anymore. Can you fix it?*

    No. If an author stopped development of an add-on, it's probably best that you find a replacement. I will not maintain special compatibility code for add-ons.

- *I created a skin for Masque. Now what?*

    Upload your skin to either WoW Interface or Curse and then post a link to the skin on [this page](http://www.wowace.com/addons/masque/pages/skin-list).
