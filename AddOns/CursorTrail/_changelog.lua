- When clicking on layer tab names ...

        Shift + Left-click  = Toggles that layer's enabled state without selecting it.

RELEASE 11.0.2.7
Released 2024-10-13

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Version 11.0.2.7 for Retail WoW
Version 4.4.0.15 for Classic Cataclysm
Version 1.15.4.2 for Classic WoW
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
NEW FEATURES:
- Save the position of the main window between reloads.

- Scroll bar buttons in popup menus will flash if there are more lines above/below those being shown.  They will also auto-repeat when held down.

- Right-clicking the colorswatch square will now switch between its current color and white (or red if the current color is white).

- Added new shapes:
        Bug (Blue)
        Bug (Orange)
        Frame (Gold)
        Frame (Gold 3D)
        Glow (Gold)
        Glyph (Green)
        Ring (Atramedes)
        Ring (Bronze)
        Ring (Eclipse)
        Ring (Gear)
        Ring (Gold)
        Ring (Horde)
        Ring (Ice)
        Ring (Meat)
        Ring (Orange)
        Ring (Reticle)
        Ring (Spotted)
        Ring (Stone)
        Ring (Stone 2)
        Shield (Alliance)
        Shield (Gold)

- Added new defaults:
        Evil Eye
        Ice Cold  ...  Not available in Classic (Vanilla) WoW.

CHANGES:
- Reversed the order of choices for "Layer Strata", so the topmost strata level is at the top of the list of choices, and moving the mousewheel up to change the selection "moves the strata level up".  (And vice-versa.)

- No longer automatically create a backup named "@v11.0.2.3".  (It was only a temporary safety measure and is no longer needed.)

- Increased the size of text in dropdown menus.

- Editboxes are slightly taller, making them easier to click.

- Increased the amount a value changes when using the mouse wheel for the following settings.  (Up/down keys still change them by 1.)
            Shadow (%) - Changes by 5 each time.
            Opacity (%) - Changes by 5 each time.
            Scale (%) - Changes by 2 each time.

- Optimized memory usage, reducing the amount of memory used when the UI opens.  (Now, an "undo" copy of all profiles is made only when a profile is modified.  Changing UI settings without saving no longer increases memory significantly.)

- Changed Help and Changelog icon buttons behavior.  Clicking them now shows and hides their corresponding windows.

- If both Help and Changelog are shown at same time, their windows will be positioned side-by-side.

- Updated code for scrolling through dropdown items with the mouse wheel while the menu is closed.  (No noticeable change.)

- Simplified code for how shapes and shadows follow the mouse position.  (No noticeable change.)

- Changed code for how shape sizes are set, so shapes whose width is different than their height can be properly displayed.  (No noticeable change.)

- Changed the color of Layer 2's shape to white for the default named "(Start Here)".  (Many of the new shapes require white to look their best.)

BUG FIXES:
- When changing shapes while "fade out" is on, the new shape now appears briefly.

- Fixed problem where the second layer's shape didn't show up immediately after loading a profile that had two shapes and the previous profile only had one.  This would only happen one time after a reload.  (BUG_20240930.1)

- Fixed problems with the "right-click swap between default values" feature.

- Fixed a bug when clicking the small up/down arrows at the top of Load and Defaults popup lists.  (The previous/next item failed to load the first time the listbox had to scroll the item into view.)

- Fixed missing warning message that asks about saving a modified default profile before loading a different profile.

Version 11.0.2.7 for Retail WoW
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        Frame (Stormy, Yellow)

        Flashy Ball Bearing

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        Soul Skull Trail
        Ring & Soul Skull
        Small Blue Green
        Sphere Orange Swirl

Version 11.0.2.6 for Retail WoW
Version 4.4.0.14 for Classic Cataclysm
Version 1.15.4.1 for Classic WoW
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
NEW FEATURES:
- Added a new profile option: "Use same profile for all characters".  When on, a small icon appears near the upper-left corner of the profile name, and that profile will be used for all characters rather than have different profiles for each character.
Note: To open profile options, click "Menu" in the main window and select "Profile Options", or type "/ct pow".

- Added slash command:
        /ct pow    (Shows/Hides the profile options window.)

- Added "Undo" to the Menu dropdown list.  It undoes unsaved changes to the current profile.  (Same as reloading the profile.)

- Added "Reset Layer" to the context menu that appears when right-clicking an empty area of the main window's background.

CHANGES:
- Added shortcut keys to Yes/No popup messages.  Pressing the Y key triggers the Yes button, and N key triggers the No button.

- When loading default profiles, many of them will keep your current settings for "Show only in combat" and "Show during Mouse Look", unless those settings are an important part of the profile's design.

- Updated the "Ring & Rainbow" default.  (Retail WoW only.)

- The profile options window can now be moved.

- Rewrote the code for displaying many of the popup messages.  (Should be no noticeable differences.)

BUG FIXES:
- Fixed bug where popup messages could be permanently covered up simply by clicking on the main UI while a message was being displayed.

- Fixed tab key cycling through editboxes.  It no longer does anything on disabled layers.

- Fixed minor bugs involving undoing changes to profiles after they were saved.  (BUG_20240925.1 and BUG_20240925.2)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NEW FEATURES:
- Added a second layer, making it possible to have two models, two shapes, two shadows, or any combination of them.
Note: If you have at least one saved profile, a backup named "@v11.0.2.3" is created to ensure your old profiles will not be lost during the conversion to the new layers format.  (Can be restored by clicking "Menu" and selecting "Restore..." from the dropdown list.)

- Added a context menu for selecting and enabling layers.  (To open the menu, right-click an empty area of the option window's background.)

            "(Start Here)"  ...  This is a good starting point for a new profile.

            "Electric B&W Rings"

- Changelog button now flashes when there is new information that has not been seen yet.  (Flashing always stops after next reload.)

- Checkboxes can be toggled on/off by clicking their text as well as their box.
Note: Classic WoW checkboxes already work this way.

CHANGES:
- Fixed error caused when moving mouse over the game's "Shop" window while CursorTrail's UI is also open.

            Trail - Sparkling, Red

- Renamed the default "Glowing Star, Red" to "Star Glow Red", and added a trail FX to it.

        /ct sparkle

- Added a memory check when combat ends.  It prints a warning if CursorTrail's memory usage ever grows too large.

        /ct screen

        /ct model
        /ct camera

- Added diagnostic command to help diagnose large frame rate drops on some computers.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
NEW FEATURES:
- Add new models to all versions.
- Added new default: "Glowing Star, Red".
- Added color-coded model categories, making it easier to see the different categories in the Model dropdown list.
- Changed the rate the mouse wheel scrolls through listbox and dropdown items.  (Scrolling faster scrolls more lines.)
- Right-clicking most of the options will now set them to their default value.
- Added a "Tips" section to the help window.

CHANGES:
- Fixed size of shapes and shadow so they stay the same size regardless of the game's UI scaling.  (Adjust CursorTrail's scale % if the shapes you like appear smaller or larger than they did before.)
- Fixed a scaling bug that cause the model's relative distance from the shape to change whenever the scale % changed.  As a result, also updated defaults that had non-zero model offsets.
  * IMPORTANT - You may need to adjust your profiles that have model offsets that are not zero.  (Sorry.)
- Fixed dropdown menus so they close if the mouse wheel is used over the text box part of the dropdown (to cycle through items).
- Fixed bug that incorrectly changed the position of cursor FX when scale % was changed using arrow keys.
- Implemented a potential fix for problems seen on ultrawide monitors. (Handled the DISPLAY_SIZE_CHANGED event.)
- Improved the "/ct reset" slash command so it can recover from more serious errors.
- Updated the UI controls and profiles libraries.

Version 10.2.7.2 for Retail WoW
Version 4.4.0.3 for Classic Cataclysm
Version 1.15.2.2 for Classic WoW
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
NEW FEATURES:
- Added UI for saving and managing profiles (saved settings).
- Profile names can now have upper and lower case letters.  (Different letter casing is ignored for comparison purposes.  For example, "dps" and "DPS" are consider the same profile name.  The last spelling used when saving a profile will be used in the profile list there after.)
- Added Backup and Restore menu actions for creating "snapshots" of all your profiles.
- Automatically create a backup of your current profiles everytime you log into the game (named "@Login").
- Automatically create a backup of your current profiles the first time the profiles UI is used (named "@Original").  This backup will never change unless you delete it using the slash command "/ct deletebackup @Original".
- Added new slash commands:
    /ct backup <backup name>
    /ct restore <backup name>
    /ct deletebackup <backup name>
    /ct listbackups
- Moved all "Defaults" buttons into one button that shows them in a popup menu.
- Added some new defaults (for Retail WoW only).

CHANGES:
- Cursor FX are now confined to the top side of the main window while the mouse is over that window.  (Easier to see changes you make.)
- Updated help, and added component version numbers at the end of it.
- Updated the UI controls library, renamed that file to "UDControls.lua" (was "Controls.lua"), and moved it to the "Lib" folder.
- Fixed color swatch button sometimes showing wrong color after "Sparkle" checkbox was turned off.
- Disable "Sparkle" checkbox whenever "Shape" is set to none.
