Cell is a nice raid frame addon inspired by several great addons, such as __CompactRaid__, __Grid2__, __Aptechka__ and __VuhDo__.
With a more human-friendly interface, Cell can provide a better user experience, better than ever.
Hope you enjoy.

## About Pull Requests

- Before submitting any PRs related to new features or feature optimizations/changes, it's best to ask me first. Otherwise, there's a high chance they won't be accepted.
- Features that are listed as "not supported" above will be rejected.

If a PR is not accepted, it might not be because it's not good enough, it just doesn't align with my design philosophy.
For rejected PRs, I suggest you implement them through code snippets.
What I want to express is that I don't oppose any code snippets making changes to Cell, even if it's not what I envisioned.
Regardless, I appreciate all the contributions you've made!
