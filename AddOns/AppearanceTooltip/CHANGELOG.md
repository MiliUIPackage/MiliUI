[Full Changelog](https://github.com/kemayo/wow-appearancetooltip/compare/v45...v45.1) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/kemayo/wow-appearancetooltip/releases)

- Update Baganator API usage  
    It has tri-state returns now, so anywhere I was just returning nil was  
    causing a performance issue.  
- Clean up some deprecated wow-api calls
