## [1.11.0](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/Mapster/tree/1.11.0) (2023-11-28)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/Mapster/compare/1.10.8...1.11.0) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/Mapster/releases)

- Add 10.2 FogClear data  
- Disable multi-version packages  
- Remove Classic support  
    Maintaining Classic support has become a huge burden for this mod, since  
    it is designed to modify the Blizzard UI, and the UI diverges even  
    further between Retail and the different Classic variants with every  
    update.  
    Hence, I rather focus my efforts on Retail, and other mods.
