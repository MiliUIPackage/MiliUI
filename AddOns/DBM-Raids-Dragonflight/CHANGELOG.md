[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/compare/10.2.29...b033ba3552e530cf9eae39f3eefc7392081fe042) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/releases)

- - Prepare Core for unified mod packaging that has both retail and classic now use same sub modules and no longer use custom packaging for classic servers (now that it's getting more complicated with cataclysm) - Added a new versioning system for classic that lets dbm version checks also show sub module versions for cataclysm, wrath, TBC, and vanilla raid mods - Core version will now only use retail versioning in unified structuring. - Core download will no longer include classic raid modules per the unified modules. Classic users will need to download those modules separately but once done will be able to update them more easily going forward. It'll even be possible to just sync retail mods over to classic with unification. All fragmentation is finally eliminated.
