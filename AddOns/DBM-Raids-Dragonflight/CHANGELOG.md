- Re-enable boss1 nameplate icon injection where enabled  
- move test mod callback position so it's sent before starting timers  
- Set default icon pixel size to 30x30 to closer match kui nameplates and plater nameplates default boss mod aura sizes.  
- Retire the hack option that hides basic timers with GUIDs and instead hide timers for objects that are using the nameplate timer type Also set simple timer type for WAs that might stlll parse by simple type in future

- Update koKR (Retail) (#945)  
- Update zhTW (GUI) (#296)

- Add fallback min timers at this point  
- Another timer adjust, also wish i had logged that bad dungeon, was like a 6 minute HH fight. Blizz needs to add a min ilvl to this queue at max level  
- create new timer stop method that achieves a way of calling a hard \"stop\" on a timer object while still passing a guid arg for callback. This will help eliminate a lot of redundant duplicate stops that are being used mainly on count timers that are also passing a guid  
- HH tweak to account for the alternate timer sequence. kind of a lazy fix cause a complex one for when hot headed and vines swap places in like 1 out of 9 pulls, isn't worth heavy effort.  
- Update koKR (#292)  
- I did not think it was possible to be this bad at headless horseman, but here we are, and now the mod supports timers for fight lasting up to like 4 minutes  
- I didn't delete that line, sign  
- Push Nymue rework from heroic retest  
- Add global disable for private aura sounds  
- Use modId rather than localized name for panel selection.  
- bump alpha
