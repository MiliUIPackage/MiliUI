# Encounter Journal Saved Instances
A fork and continuation of [Adventure Guide Saved Instances](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/adventure-guide-saved-instances) WoW AddOn.

Tracks instance lockouts with your Encounter Journal, including World Bosses and LFR. A flag will be displayed on the instance's button for each difficulty with details on available and killed bosses.

This AddOn is dependant on your client's language, meaning some instances may not be shown as intended. I have already fixed some of them for english and french clients, but it may remain some that still need to be fixed. To help me with debugging, open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Meivyn/EncounterJournalSavedInstances/issues) specifying which instance don't work and your client's locales, so I could fix them as soon as I can.
