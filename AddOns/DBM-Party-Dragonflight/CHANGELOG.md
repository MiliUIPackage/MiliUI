- Fix  
- Start getting translations now  
- Add another tank ability warning to jade temple  
- Interrupt warning fires on Kokia regardless of whether add is targetted or not.  
    Added general announce for Dark Claw to jade temple  
- adjust option default on Quelling strike due to it's poor visuals and often being pulled with other mobs to point it's easy to be a hazard not just to tanks but all melee  
- fixed bug where bloodletting sweep timer didn't start again after first cast on Hymdall
