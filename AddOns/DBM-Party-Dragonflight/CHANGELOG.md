- fix variable from last  
- Reworked tyr's combo to include 3rd ability and improved logic further so that timers for 3rd and 4 cast are known, and itmers for 1st and 2nd show all possible abilities  
- Update Iridikron timers with nerfed ones  
- This one boss took over 2 hours because it's hard as hell ot find logs for an undertuned boss. None the less i think this fixes all the blight of galakrond timer issues with live changes  
- Fix manafested timeways for live  
- Update Chronikar's timers to the nerfed live ones
