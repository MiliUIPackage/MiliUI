[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Dungeons/compare/r84...r86) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Dungeons/releases)

- Wratheye Fixes:  
     - Don't distract healer with attack totem messages. they have plenty to heal on this boss.  
     - Fix tank message never showing  
     - Fix voice alert to a better one for choking rotcloud  
- make ensaring trap message more clear.  
- improve marked for butchery  
- fixed a minoir bug where stage 3 announce on harlan sweete says 2 instead  
- Fix stance of mountain thanks to Linaori providing a better log.  
    Also improved other 3 timers by adding typical auto correction that accounts for spell ICDs  
- tweaks and fixes to infested crawg  
- massively increase emphasis on maddening gaze. it's a hard to see visual and almost always a wipe if hit by it. since blizzard can't be hothered to make non crap visuals in dungeons. mods just have to be obnoxiously loud and flashy (ie made audio countdown on by default for tanks and change default emphasis to big red repeating flash)  
- fixed a bug where suds alert could spam on huge pulls  
- Redid Infested Crawg timers with a more perminant and cleaner solution for the massive timer variances and different ability orders that can hanppen.  
    Also updated a timer on unbound which was changed recently  
- Rework timers after combining multiple discoveries that seem to account for every variation seen on sargha. This new code should have accurate timers pausing/unpausing with auto correction for spell queues and ICDs  
- Adjust gut shot timer
