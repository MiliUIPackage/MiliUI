- move dungeon mods using gossip to core apis so they run through global filter  
- Shorten "winds of change" to just "winds" on Kyrakka and Erkhart and add wind direction to alerts and timer text  
- Update zhTW (#90)  
    Co-authored-by: Adam <MysticalOS@users.noreply.github.com>  
- close statement  
- Add off target regular cast announce for tempest since it's so much damage on high keys, you need to know it's casting even if it's not a focus target  
- Add bait announces 3.5 seconds before big add, and boulder spawns to Kokia. This boss proves only difficult when groups poorly manage placements
