# Details! - Skin 'The War Within' Dark Mode

World of Warcraft Addon that adds the **'The War Within'** Skin (inspired by **/u/Sm0keO**) to **Details!**. Originally forked from https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details-skin-the-war-within, opened a PR but author never responded to add this dark mode, so i've made it into its own addon. :( Hopefully in future we can just have this in one addon

## How to use

Open the _Details!_ options ('/details options'), and apply the Skin under **Options > Skins > Skin > 'The War Within Dark'**.

If you have issues with Details overriding your settings, you can also use **'/tww import'** to import a default profile, which doesn't use the skin directly, but has the style/textures etc set manually.
